Welcome to my page. Let's get connected.

====

I am a curious, innovative, and result-oriented experimental particle physicist with over 6 years of hardware and software experience. I was stationed at Jefferson Lab, one of the National Accelerator Facility of the Department of Energy, to work as a research assistant as part of the graduate program. I have received several travel awards to present the results from my research and attend the conferences. I was given the "Excellence in Research Award" from the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Mississippi State University in the Fall of 2020.
